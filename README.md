## Shopping List v1.3

> This application is the playground for my Java Programming learning curve. My goal is to create a full-fledged working system of a simple shopping list or reminder list purely in Java using inbuilt and external libraries, like the Apache Commons IO Library.

> I would like to thank [@aldefy](https://github.com/aldefy). for introducing me to this programming language and helping me with those teeny-tiny bugs from time to time! :)
