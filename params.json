{"name":"Shopping List","tagline":"A Simple Shopping List Program developed in Java for Learning Purposes","body":"Hey there!\r\nMy name is [Amruth A. Pillai](https://facebook.com/AmruthPillai) and you're awesome.\r\n\r\nThis application is the playground for my Java Programming learning curve. My goal is to create a full-fledged working system of a simple shopping list or reminder list purely in Java using inbuilt and external libraries, like the Apache Commons IO Library.\r\n\r\nI care a great deal about indentation and commenting my code, so be on the look out for the way I organize my code and the documentation.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank [@aldefy](https://github.com/aldefy). for introducing me to this programming language and helping me with those teeny-tiny bugs from time to time! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n###Change Log\r\n\r\n**v1.6 - Added: Error Handling Exceptions**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 24th June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Added an instruction whenever user tries to delete or display a list that does not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n**v1.5 - Updated: Created Object for ListActivities**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 24th June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Created an object reference for the ListActivities class and replaced the while loop with a do while loop for more optimization.\r\n\r\n**v1.4 - Added: Option to Remove Individual Item**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 23rd June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Added the functionality to remove a particular item from the Shopping List by typing the Item Name.\r\n\r\n**v1.3 - Updated: File Management**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 23rd June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Updated the functionality from storing items in an ArrayList to storing items in a portable text file called 'shoppinglist.txt'.\r\n\r\n**v1.2 - Added: Clear Shopping List**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 22nd June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Added the functionality to delete/clear the elements of the ArrayList.\r\n\r\n**v1.1 - Created First Application**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 22nd June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Created an application that stores items in an ArrayList and displays the same.\r\n\r\n**v1.0 - First Commit**\r\n\r\n\tDtd: 22nd June 2014\r\n\tDesc: Welcomed myself to the world of Java Programming.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
